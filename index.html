    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A refined top-down, single-page dashboard guides the user from the main conclusion to detailed evidence. It starts with 'The Verdict' (direct answer), then expands 'By the Numbers' with more commercial context and critical acclaim. 'The Adaptation Puzzle' offers deeper insight into chapter pacing, explicitly mentioning manga arcs and specific events. 'Fan & Industry Buzz' provides qualitative insights and more examples of community and industry actions. Finally, 'Future Scenarios' is thoroughly broken down with stronger arguments and an estimated timeline. This thematic structure enhances exploration, allowing users to delve into specific data points or broader trends seamlessly. Interactions like chart tooltips and smooth navigation are maintained, with added subtle visual feedback on interactive elements for a premium feel. -->

                        <p class="text-slate-700 mt-2 text-sm leading-relaxed">The *My Dress-Up Darling* fan community is exceptionally active and vocal, especially on platforms like Reddit (e.g., r/SonoBisqueDoll), Twitter, specialized anime forums, and fan art communities. Discussions frequently and intensely revolve around the series' continuation, with the most prevalent theories converging on either a **feature film or a shorter, final season** to adapt the manga's remaining story. There is a palpable and strong collective desire for a truly satisfying anime conclusion, particularly as some fans felt the manga's concluding chapters, while impactful, were somewhat abrupt in their pacing in the original serialization. This consistent, highly engaged discussion unequivocally highlights the **enduring global popularity** and overwhelming audience demand for a definitive anime finale, which production committees are highly attuned to and often factor into their strategic decisions for maximizing fan satisfaction and engagement.</p>

                        <p class="text-slate-700 mt-2 text-sm leading-relaxed">Concluding a highly popular anime series with a **theatrical film** has rapidly become a well-established, highly profitable, and strategically preferred trend across the industry. This approach is almost always adopted for franchises with a finite, manageable amount of source material left after initial TV seasons. Notable and successful examples illustrating this strategic move include <span class="highlight-text">**_The Quintessential Quintuplets Movie_**</span> (which served as a hugely successful finale for that romantic comedy series), <span class="highlight-text">**_Sword Art Online Progressive: Aria of a Starless Night_**</span> (which expanded an existing arc into a cinematic experience), and the eagerly anticipated <span class="highlight-text">**_Haikyu!!_ finale films**</span> (set to conclude the beloved sports anime's epic story). This format allows for a concentrated, high-profile theatrical release that can generate significant global box office revenue, lead to a lucrative premium home video release, and effectively monetize the series' climax, all while expertly bypassing the logistical difficulties and potentially lower returns of producing a non-standard length TV season.</p>

                <p class="text-center text-slate-700 max-w-3xl mx-auto mb-14 text-lg leading-relaxed">Given the overwhelming commercial success, the strategic completion of the manga, and the precise amount of remaining source material, a continuation of the anime is, simply put, a near certainty.
